# KDD_Assigning_people_to_groups

P1: The event will feature 4 different workshops: A, B, C, D. The seating limit for each of these workshops is 60 people. Participants gave their preference of classes by ranking the workshops in the following order: from those they would most like to attend to those they would least like to attend. If a participant left a space blank, that is, he is indifferent to which workshops he will be enrolled in. 
Your task is to write a script that will allow you to scatter participants into groups ensuring that they are as consistent as possible with their preferences. The assignment should be random and each person should have the same probability of getting into the workshops they wanted to attend. Each participant must be enrolled in exactly two workshops.
Attached to the message is a file with the list of participants and their preferences. Line 
“C Maria;B;C;A;D”
means that participant “C Maria” is most likely to go to workshop B, followed by C, then A, while she doesn't much feel like going to workshop D.
